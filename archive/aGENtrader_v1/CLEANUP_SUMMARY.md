# Multi-Agent Trading System: Cleanup and Restructuring

## Completed Tasks

### Directory Structure Reorganization
- Created logical directory structure separating core components
- Organized agent code into technical, fundamental, and portfolio specialists
- Established data management with sources and storage modules
- Set up backtesting framework with core components and scripts

### Code Cleanup
- Archived redundant and duplicate files
- Removed outdated test scripts and logs
- Eliminated frontend dependencies to focus on backend
- Preserved historical code in organized archive structure

### API Integration
- Created Python API wrapper for the trading system
- Set up Express.js server as API interface
- Established clear API endpoints for system functions
- Implemented proper error handling and logging

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive README files for each component
- Documented API endpoints and usage
- Provided examples of system functionality
- Added explanations of system architecture

### Backend Focus
- Removed frontend components to focus solely on trading engine
- Created minimal server to provide API access to trading system
- Set up testing infrastructure for backend components
- Enhanced logging for better debugging

```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Check system health
- `GET /api/system` - Get system information
- `POST /api/decision` - Request a trading decision
- `POST /api/backtest` - Run a backtest

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the Python trading system implementation
2. Develop comprehensive testing scenarios
3. Improve data integration with database
4. Implement proper error handling across all components
5. Consider developing a frontend in future phases
