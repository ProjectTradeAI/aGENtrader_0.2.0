# Multi-Agent Trading System Reorganization Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Directory Structure Reorganization
- Created logical directory structure with agents, data, orchestration, and backtesting
- Organized specialized agents into technical, fundamental, and portfolio subdirectories
- Set up data management with sources and storage components
- Established backtesting framework with core, analysis, and utils components

### 2. Code Cleanup
- Archived redundant and duplicate files
- Removed outdated test scripts and logs
- Consolidated similar functionality
- Eliminated deprecated code paths
- Preserved historical code in organized archive

### 3. Documentation
- Created comprehensive README files for each component
- Documented system architecture and interactions
- Added usage examples for critical modules
- Created clear instructions for running the system

### 4. Testing and Verification
- Developed test_system.py to verify system integrity
- Confirmed all components can be imported correctly
- Validated directory structure and critical files
- Ensured core functionality remains intact

### 5. Dependency Management
- Confirmed required dependencies in requirements.txt
- Installed necessary Python packages (pandas, numpy, sqlalchemy, etc.)
- Set up example environment configuration
