RESPONSE:
Apologies, as an AI text model by OpenAI, I don't have real-time data access to provide the latest Bitcoin price or any other live updates. However, I can guide you on how to analyze current prices. With BTCUSDT, look for patterns on price charts, and consider indicators like trading volume, recent market trends, support and resistance levels, and others. Always take into account global sentiments as Bitcoin price largely reacts to worldwide events and developments in crypto regulations.
