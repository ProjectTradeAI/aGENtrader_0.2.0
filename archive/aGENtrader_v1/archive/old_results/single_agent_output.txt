As an AI, I can't perform these functions directly, but I can provide possible analysis. 

Upon using get_latest_price("BTCUSDT"), consider if the price has increased or decreased compared to its previous values. If it increased, BTC is currently bullish, signaling a good time to sell if you have earlier investments. However, a decrease signifies a bearish trend, indicating a good buying opportunity. 

Moving next to get_market_summary("BTCUSDT", "1h"), watch out for the high and low prices in the last hour. If the latest price from the first function is closer to the high price, the uptrend may be ongoing; if it's closer to the low, the bearish trend may continue.

Also, examine trading volume. Higher volume during an uptrend demonstrates strong investor interest, reinforcing the upward price movement. Conversely, high volume during a downtrend might suggest a possible reversal due to selling pressure exhaustion. Remember, investing in markets involves risk.
