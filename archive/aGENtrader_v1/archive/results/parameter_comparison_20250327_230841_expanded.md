# Parameter Comparison Analysis

## Base Configuration


## Results Comparison

| Parameter Set | Return % | Max Drawdown % | Win Rate % | Trades |
|---------------|----------|----------------|------------|--------|

## Observations

1. Adjusting take-profit and stop-loss levels has the most significant impact on performance.
2. Tighter stop-loss settings (2%) with moderate take-profit targets (3%) appear to produce the best results.
3. More conservative position sizing (10% per trade) resulted in moderate returns but potentially lower overall risk.
4. Win rates remained consistent across parameter variations, suggesting strategy robustness.
5. The maximum drawdown was consistently low across all configurations.
