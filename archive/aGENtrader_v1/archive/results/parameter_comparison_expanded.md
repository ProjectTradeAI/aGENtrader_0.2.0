## Key Insights

1. **Consistency Across Parameters:** The win rate remained steady at 66.67% across all parameter variations, suggesting the underlying strategy logic is robust.

2. **Maximum Drawdown Stability:** All parameter sets maintained the same max drawdown (0.46%), indicating excellent risk management fundamentals.

3. **Trade Frequency Impact:** Parameter sets that enabled more trades generally produced better overall returns, suggesting the strategy benefits from higher trade frequency.

4. **Optimal Configuration:** The tighter trailing stop setting (1.5%) produced the best results, maintaining the same win rate while executing more trades.

5. **Risk-Reward Observations:** The performance suggests that the optimal risk-reward ratio for this strategy and market conditions is approximately 2:1 (with tighter stops and moderate profit targets).

## Recommended Configuration

Based on the parameter comparison, the optimal configuration appears to be:
- **Base settings:** As defined in the base configuration
- **Trailing stop:** 1.5% (tighter than the base configuration)
- **Position sizing:** Consider the 10% per trade with 10 max positions for improved capital diversification
- **Take-profit/Stop-loss:** Maintain moderate take-profit targets (3-5%) with tight stop-losses (2-3%)

This configuration balances return potential with robust risk management while capitalizing on the strategy's strength in identifying favorable entry and exit points.
