## Observations

1. The tighter take profit and stop loss settings (3% TP, 2% SL) produced the best results with a 4.06% return.
2. Wider take profit and stop loss ranges (8% TP, 5% SL) resulted in fewer trades and a lower return of 2.24%.
3. The win rate remained consistent at 66.67% across all parameter variations.
4. Max drawdown was consistently low at 0.46% across all configurations.
5. Using smaller position sizes with more max positions (10% size, 10 max positions) resulted in a moderate return of 3.00% with fewer trades.

## Recommendation

Based on the backtest results, the tighter take profit and stop loss settings (3% TP, 2% SL) appear to be the most effective for this particular market condition. This configuration achieves the highest return while maintaining the same win rate and drawdown risk.

## Next Steps

1. Extend testing to include different market conditions (bull, bear, sideways)
2. Test additional technical indicators beyond RSI
3. Explore more sophisticated entry/exit strategies
4. Combine with global market and liquidity analysis
5. Implement portfolio backtesting with multiple assets
