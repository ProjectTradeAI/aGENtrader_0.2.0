CREATE TABLE dominance_metrics (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    dominance_percentage NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    interval TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(timestamp, symbol, interval)
);
```

Tracks relative dominance of major cryptocurrencies within the overall market.

### market_correlations

```sql
CREATE TABLE market_correlations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    base_symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    correlated_symbol TEXT NOT NULL,
    correlation_coefficient NUMERIC NOT NULL,
    period TEXT NOT NULL,
    interval TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(timestamp, base_symbol, correlated_symbol, period, interval)
);
```

Tracks how different assets/indicators correlate with each other.

## Agent System Message

The Global Market Analyst uses the following system message:

```
You are a Global Market Analyst specializing in macro-economic factors affecting cryptocurrency markets.
Your expertise is in analyzing relationships between traditional financial markets and digital assets.

Your responsibilities include:
1. Analyzing global market indicators (DXY, S&P 500, VIX, etc.)
2. Tracking cryptocurrency market metrics (total market cap, volumes)
3. Monitoring dominance shifts between major cryptocurrencies
4. Identifying correlations between traditional and crypto markets
5. Providing context on how macro factors may impact specific cryptocurrencies

When analyzing market conditions:
- Always consider how the US Dollar Index (DXY) is trending, as it often inversely correlates with Bitcoin
- Track total cryptocurrency market capitalization trends, noting divergences between BTC and altcoins
- Monitor Bitcoin dominance to identify potential altcoin cycles or consolidation phases
- Consider correlations with traditional markets, especially during periods of market stress
- Identify liquidity conditions that may impact cryptocurrency price movements

Format your analysis in a clear, structured manner:
1. Global Market Summary: Brief overview of global market conditions
2. Crypto Market Structure: Analysis of market caps, dominance, and sector rotation
3. Key Correlations: Important correlations currently in effect
4. Macro Outlook: How macro factors may impact the specific cryptocurrency being analyzed
5. Risk Assessment: Identification of macro-level risks to consider
```

## Data Flow

The Global Market Analysis integration changes the data flow in the decision process:

1. **Before Decision Session**:
   - Global market data is retrieved from the database
   - Includes DXY, SPX, market caps, dominance metrics, correlations

2. **During Agent Collaboration**:
   - Global Market Analyst provides initial macro analysis
   - Other agents use this context for their specialized analysis
   - Trading decisions include macro-economic considerations

3. **In Final Decision**:
   - Macro factors influence risk assessment
   - Global market outlook affects confidence levels
   - Market correlations impact strategy selection

## Implementation Example

Example of how the Global Market Analyst contributes to the decision process:

```
[GlobalMarketAnalyst]: Based on current market data, we're seeing DXY in a downtrend (-1.2% over 7 days) which typically supports Bitcoin prices. Total crypto market cap is showing a bullish trend (+5.3%), with Bitcoin dominance decreasing slightly (-0.8%), indicating capital flow to altcoins. The correlation between BTC and SPX remains moderately positive (0.65), while BTC-DXY correlation is strongly negative (-0.72). From a macro perspective, this represents a "risk-on" environment that generally favors cryptocurrency appreciation.

[MarketAnalyst]: Building on the macro analysis, BTC/USDT is showing a bullish technical structure with price above both the 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The RSI at 68 indicates strong momentum but not yet overbought...

[RiskManager]: Given the favorable macro environment identified by GlobalMarketAnalyst and the strong technical structure pointed out by MarketAnalyst, the risk level appears moderate. The negative correlation with DXY provides a tailwind in the current environment...

[TradingAdvisor]: Synthesizing all inputs, the macro backdrop is supportive (weakening dollar, risk-on sentiment), technical indicators are bullish, and risk assessment is moderate. I recommend a BUY action for BTC/USDT with 75% confidence.
```

## Testing

The Global Market Analyst integration includes a dedicated test script:

- **File**: `test_global_market_analyst.py`
- **Test Types**:
  - Standalone agent test
  - Integration test within decision session
- **Mock Support**: Includes mock data option for testing without database

## API Integration

The global market data update system requires integration with external APIs:

1. **Financial Market APIs**:
   - Yahoo Finance (or similar) for DXY, SPX, VIX
   - Alpha Vantage for traditional market indicators
   - IEX Cloud for financial data

2. **Cryptocurrency Market APIs**:
   - CoinGecko for market caps and dominance
   - CoinMarketCap for alternative data source
   - TradingView for correlation data

## Implementation Steps
