Trading Strategy:  
- Name: Bullish Dip Buying Strategy  
- Period: Daily (1D)  
- Entry:  
  - Enter long positions when Bitcoin retraces to the $27,000 support level or triggers a bullish reversal candle pattern within 3% of this level.  
  - Confirm entry with a supporting bullish crossover from the 50-day moving average above the 200-day moving average and an RSI below 70 to avoid overbought conditions.  
- Exit:  
  - Set initial target at $35,000, which is a key resistance level.  
  - Consider closing half of the position at $35,000 and set a trailing stop-loss to capture further upside.
