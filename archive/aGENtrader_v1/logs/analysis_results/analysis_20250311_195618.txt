=== Market Analysis ===

Trading Strategy:  
- Name: **Bullish Pullback Strategy**  
- Period: **4-hour timeframe**  
- Entry: **Long position on price retracement to $26,500 or $25,000 support levels, confirmed by bullish candlestick patterns (such as engulfing or hammer) and a MACD crossover above the signal line.**  
- Exit: **Target at $30,000 for partial profit-taking; if the price breaks above this level, set a trailing stop to capture further gains, with an additional target at $32,500.**  
- Risk: **Use a maximum risk of 1% of the trading capital per trade. Place stop-loss orders 2% below the entry point to hedge against unexpected price movements, ideally below the support levels of $26,500 or $25,000.**  

Implementation Steps:  
1. **Identify and Monitor Key Support Levels:** Regularly analyze the market for Bitcoin price approaching either $26,500 or $25,000 levels.  
2. **Confirm Entry Conditions:** Wait for a bullish candlestick pattern to form at the support level and ensure MACD confirms an upward trend.  
3. **Set Entry and Stop-Loss Orders:** Once entry conditions are met, place long orders with a stop-loss set below the identified support levels.  
4. **Set Price Targets:** Establish your profit targets at $30,000 and $32,500 based on resistance analysis.  
5. **Utilize Risk Management Tools:** Adhere to the 1% maximum risk rule by computing position size relative to total trading capital.  
6. **Monitor Market Sentiment:** Continuously track external factors influencing Bitcoin, including news and sentiment shifts that may impact price movements.  
7. **Adjust Trailing Stop on Breakouts:** Upon reaching $30,000, adjust the stop-loss to safeguard profits and allow for upside capture if ascending momentum continues.  
8. **Review and Document:** After closing positions, review your trades, document the outcomes and refine strategies based on lessons learned to improve future trading performance.  

This strategy leverages market analysis while integrating effective risk management to optimize potential returns on Bitcoin trades in the current bullish landscape.
