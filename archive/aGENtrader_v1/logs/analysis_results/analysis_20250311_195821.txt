**Complete Trading Strategy:**

1. **Strategy Overview:**
   - Name: **Bullish Bitcoin Momentum Strategy**
   - Timeframe: **Short-term (Daily)**
   - Type: **Trend Following Strategy**

2. **Entry Strategy:**
   - Primary Entry: Enter a long position at $30,000 for a short-term trade, or at $28,500 during market dips to capitalize on strong support levels. For aggressive traders, enter at the breakout above the resistance level of $35,000.
   - Confirmation Signals: 
     - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicating bullish momentum.
     - Price action confirmation with a strong close above the aforementioned resistance level combined with increasing volume.
   - Entry Price Levels: 
     - $30,000 (standard entry)
     - $28,500 (during pullbacks)
     - $35,000 (breakout entry)

3. **Exit Strategy:**
   - Profit Targets: 
     - First target at $35,000 (1st profit level).
     - Second target at $40,000 (2nd profit level).
     - Long-term target at $50,000 if bullish sentiment continues.
   - Stop-Loss: Set a stop-loss below $27,000 to mitigate risks, ensuring placement slightly below the identified strong support zone.
   - Position Management: Scale out 50% of the position at the first target ($35,000), then trailing the remaining position to the second and third levels as momentum continues.

4. **Risk Management:**
   - Position Sizing: Calculate position size based on account size and risk tolerance. For instance, if risking 2% of a $10,000 account, the maximum risk would be $200. If the difference between entry price and stop-loss is $3,000 ($30,000 entry and $27,000 stop-loss), the position size would be approximately 0.067 BTC ($200 / $3000).
   - Risk Per Trade: Maximum risk per trade set at **2% of total account equity**.
   - Portfolio Allocation: Limit exposure to BTC in the portfolio to a maximum of **10%** of total account value to maintain diversification and manage overall risk across the portfolio.

5. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Setup Requirements: Utilize trading platforms with access to charting tools, indicators (MACD, RSI), and alerts set for price levels of $30,000, $28,500, and $35,000.
   - Execution Steps: 
     1. Monitor price action around the identified entry levels and confirm MACD and volume signals.
     2. Execute order upon confirmation near the entry points.
     3. Implement stop-loss orders immediately upon entry to lock in risk management.
   - Monitoring Rules: 
     - Regularly observe the RSI to manage overbought conditions; consider manual adjustments if RSI exceeds 75.
     - Keep track of MACD divergence to identify potential trend reversal points, signaling exit or adjustment of positions.

This strategy capitalizes on bullish trends observed in the Bitcoin market while ensuring robust risk management protocols to protect investment and enhance profit potential.
