**Trading Strategy:**

**1. Strategy Overview:**
   - **Strategy name:** BTC Optimal Bullish Accumulation Strategy 
   - **Trading timeframe:** 1-Hour and 4-Hour charts for precision in entries and exits. 
   - **Overall approach:** This strategy focuses on taking long positions during bullish trends with confirmation from technical indicators and price action. It aims to capitalize on short-term pullbacks and consolidation phases within a primarily upward-moving market. 
   - **Market conditions:** The strategy is tailored for bullish market conditions, specifically for Bitcoin, given the positive sentiment, increased buying volume, and favorable technical indicators.

**2. Entry Strategy:**
   - **Entry conditions:** Enter long positions when Bitcoin retraces to key support levels ($25,000 or $26,500) with confirmation signals such as bullish candlestick patterns or breakouts above resistance levels.
   - **Entry price levels:** Primary entry around $25,000 (if price rebounds), secondary entry if taking a pullback around $26,500 to confirm support.
   - **Entry confirmation signals:** Look for bullish formations such as a bullish engulfing candle or a break and close above the recent high (e.g., $28,000) after a consolidation phase.
   - **Position sizing rules:** Risk no more than 2% of the trading capital on a single trade. Use a calculator to size positions based on the distance to the stop-loss level.

**3. Exit Strategy:**
   - **Profit targets:** Initial target set at $30,000. Take partial profit (e.g., 50% of the position) at this level and set the remainder for a further target around $32,000.
   - **Stop-loss levels:** Initial stop-loss at $24,000 for entries around $25,000. For entries around $26,500, consider a stop-loss at $25,500. Adjust stop-loss to break even after reaching the first profit target.
   - **Position management:** Upon reaching profit targets, reassess market conditions for potential re-entries if the upward trend continues and adjust stop-loss accordingly to lock in profits.
   - **Scaling rules:** As the price approaches key resistance levels, consider scaling out of positions gradually (e.g., 25% at $30,000, 25% at $32,000).
