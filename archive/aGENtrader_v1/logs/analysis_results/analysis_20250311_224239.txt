   - **Execution steps:** 
     - Monitor the price action for entry points, execute the buy orders at set levels, place stop loss orders immediately after entering the trade, and set profit target levels. 
   - **Monitoring process:** 
     - Regularly review market conditions, watch for significant price movements at resistance and support levels, and adjust stop-loss and profit targets based on price action and volume trends. Check technical indicators daily for any changes in trend dynamics.
