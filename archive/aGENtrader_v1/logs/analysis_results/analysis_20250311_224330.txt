=== Market Analysis ===

1. **Strategy Overview:**
   - **Strategy Name:** Bullish Bitcoin Bounce Strategy (BBBS)
   - **Trading Timeframe:** Daily (D1)
   - **Market Conditions:** The strategy is designed for a bullish market environment, leveraging upward momentum, confirmed trend strength via ADX, and favorable technical signals.

2. **Entry and Exit Rules:**
   - **Entry Conditions:** 
     - Enter a long position when Bitcoin's price retraces to the support level of $28,500, confirmed by an upward momentum signal from the MACD and an RSI reading below 70.
     - Buy when the daily close is above the 50-day moving average, indicating strong bullish momentum.

   - **Exit Conditions:**
     - Set a first profit target at $32,000 and a second target at $35,000 based on historical resistance levels.
     - Additionally, if the price closes below the 50-day moving average, this will trigger an exit to protect profits.

   - **Position Sizing:**
     - Use a fixed percentage method, risking no more than 2% of the trading capital per trade and adjusting position size according to the distance from entry point to stop loss level.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - **Stop Loss Rules:** 
     - Place a stop-loss order at $26,000, just below the key support level. This provides a safety net against deeper retracements while allowing for the volatility typical in Bitcoin trading.

   - **Risk Per Trade:** 
     - Limit risk to 2% of the total trading capital on any single trade, ensuring that trading remains sustainable even through multiple losses.

   - **Portfolio Allocation:** 
     - Allocate no more than 10% of the total trading capital to this strategy to diversify risk across different assets.

4. **Implementation Plan:**
   - **Required Indicators:**
     - 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify the trend direction.
     - ADX to gauge trend strength (look for readings above 25).
     - CCI to confirm momentum direction.
     - RSI to monitor overbought conditions.
     - MACD for entry signals and confirmation.

   - **Execution Steps:**
     - Monitor the price for any retracement toward $28,500 and set alerts to get notified when price approaches entry.
     - Enter a long position once entry conditions are met (price at $28,500 with necessary indicator confirmations).
     - Set stop-loss and take-profit orders immediately upon entry to ensure proper risk management.

   - **Monitoring Process:**
     - Daily review of price action, trend indicators, and key support/resistance levels.
     - Adjust stop loss to breakeven once first profit target at $32,000 is hit, locking in profit while allowing for further upside.
     - Regularly evaluate market conditions and adjust strategies for potential trend changes or shifts in market sentiment.

This strategic approach to trading Bitcoin effectively capitalizes on current market trends, ensuring a clear framework with defined rules for entry, exit, risk management, and implementation.
