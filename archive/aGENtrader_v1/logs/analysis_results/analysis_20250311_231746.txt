=== Market Analysis ===

1. **Strategy Overview:**
   - **Strategy name:** Bullish Momentum Strategy
   - **Trading timeframe:** Daily (1D) chart
   - **Market conditions:** Bullish trend, supported by strong demand indicated by volume, trend strength reflected by ADX above 25, and positive momentum from moving averages and MACD.

2. **Entry and Exit Rules:**
   - **Entry conditions:** 
      - Buy when the price retraces to $30,500 or $31,000, confirming support.
      - Ensure that the RSI is below 70 to avoid overbought conditions.
      - Confirm upward momentum with a bullish MACD crossover.
   - **Exit conditions:** 
      - Sell when the price reaches $34,000 or $36,000 as these are identified resistance levels.
      - Alternatively, exit if the price closes below the 50-day moving average for three consecutive days, indicating a potential trend reversal.
   - **Position sizing:** 
      - Use 2% of total trading capital per trade, assessing volatility to determine the number of Bitcoin units to buy based on the current price.

3. **Risk Management:**
   - **Stop loss rules:** 
      - Place a stop-loss order at $29,000, ensuring it is above the support zone to mitigate unnecessary losses during market fluctuations.
   - **Risk per trade:** 
      - Limit risk to 1% of total trading capital, calculated based on distance of entry from stop loss.
   - **Portfolio allocation:** 
      - Dedicate not more than 20% of the total trading capital to Bitcoin to ensure sufficient diversification across other assets.

4. **Implementation Plan:**
   - **Required indicators:** 
      - Average Directional Index (ADX) for trend strength analysis.
      - Moving Averages (50-day and 200-day) to confirm bullish signals.
      - Relative Strength Index (RSI) for overbought conditions.
      - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for momentum signals.
   - **Execution steps:** 
      - Monitor price action daily for potential retracement to targeted entry levels.
      - Use trading platforms to set conditional orders (limit orders) at entry points.
      - Activate stop-loss orders immediately once positions are opened.
   - **Monitoring process:** 
      - Review the daily chart for ongoing confirmation of bullish trends.
      - Watch for changes in volume and any reversal signals from indicators (e.g., bearish MACD crossover or significant RSI movements).
      - Adjust profit targets and stop-loss orders based on market conditions and price action.

This Bullish Momentum Strategy is crafted to capitalize on the current bullish trend in Bitcoin with a structured approach to entering, exiting, and managing trades effectively while ensuring a risk-managed trading environment.
