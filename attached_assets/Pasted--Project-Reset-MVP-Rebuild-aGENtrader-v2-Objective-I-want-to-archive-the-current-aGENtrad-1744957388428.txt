🛠️ Project Reset & MVP Rebuild: aGENtrader_v2

🎯 Objective:
I want to archive the current aGENtrader codebase as version 1 and start with a clean, minimal backend architecture focused only on core AI-enhanced trading decision-making.
This version (v2) will be modular, agent-driven, and powered by AutoGen Core with mock or local LLM support during development, and production-ready deployment to EC2 once tested.

🗃️ Phase 1: Archive & Clean Up
	1	Archive the current implementation under a new subfolder and commit to GitHub:
	◦	Folder name: aGENtrader_v1
	◦	Retain version history and file structure
	2	Set up a fresh and minimal root structure for aGENtrader (v2) with no frontend or UI code. The focus is purely backend.
	3	Retain the existing SQLite or Postgres DB already populated with historical market data. Do not delete or reset this.
	4	Clean the Replit environment:
	◦	Remove virtual environments (.venv, .mypy_cache, __pycache__, poetry.lock, etc.)
	◦	Remove or archive the old requirements.txt
	◦	Create a minimal, fresh requirements.txt including only essential dependencies:
	▪	autogen
	▪	autogen-ext
	▪	requests
	▪	sqlite3 (or relevant DB lib)
	▪	Optional: openai for later use

🧠 Phase 2: Backend MVP Implementation
Goal: Deliver a minimal working pipeline where AI agents process real market data and return a structured trading decision using AutoGen Core.

🔁 MVP Workflow:
	1	The Orchestrator sends an event to:
	◦	MarketAnalystAgent
	◦	LiquidityAnalystAgent
	◦	(Later additions: OnChainAnalystAgent, SentimentAnalystAgent)
	2	Each agent uses:
	◦	A local or mock LLM via a centralized LLMClient abstraction
	◦	PythonCodeExecutor via autogen_ext.executors to analyze or simulate logic
	3	The DecisionAgent collects outputs and produces:
json
{
  "action": "BUY",
  "pair": "BTC/USDT",
  "confidence": 87,
  "reason": "Strong market structure + deep liquidity detected"
}
	4	The decision is logged or printed for now — no actual trading execution in this stage.

🧩 Additional LLM Considerations:
Due to Replit’s RAM/storage limits, do not attempt to run large local models (e.g., Mixtral) inside Replit.
Instead:
	•	Use TinyLlama or a mock LLM response for dev/testing.
	•	Implement an LLMClient abstraction module that supports:
	◦	"mock" for fast development
	◦	"ollama" for local testing on EC2 (e.g., Mixtral, Mistral)
	◦	"openai" for remote API support (optional, post-MVP)
This lets you build once, and swap models/configs later.

✅ Tasks for You (Replit Agent):
	•	Archive and restructure the project as described
	•	Reset environment and generate a fresh requirements.txt
	•	Implement:
	◦	One working agent (LiquidityAnalystAgent)
	◦	LLMClient with at least a "mock" mode
	◦	A minimal orchestrator that sends an event and receives the decision
	•	Log all outputs to file (e.g., logs/agent_output.log) to avoid Replit console truncation issues
	•	Comment all code for extensibility
Once this MVP is working:
	•	I will port it to EC2
	•	Swap the LLMClient to "ollama" for Mixtral
	•	Extend to include real-time market data and full trade execution
Start by listing the cleanup and implementation plan, then proceed step-by-step.
