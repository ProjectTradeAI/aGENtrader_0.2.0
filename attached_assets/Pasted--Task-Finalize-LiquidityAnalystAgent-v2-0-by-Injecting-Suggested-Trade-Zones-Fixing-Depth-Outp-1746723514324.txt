### Task: Finalize LiquidityAnalystAgent v2.0 by Injecting Suggested Trade Zones + Fixing Depth Output

The LiquidityAnalystAgent is now successfully detecting microstructure patterns and issuing high-quality BUY/SELL signals. However, its final output is **missing key actionable fields** and contains incorrect depth metrics.

---

### âœ… Patch Objectives

#### 1. **Inject Suggested Entry, Stop Loss, and Take Profit**

Using the identified **bid and ask volume spikes**, extract:
- `suggested_entry`: the **most relevant strong bid level** below market price (e.g. from a detected cluster or outlier)
- `suggested_stop_loss`: 1.0% below `suggested_entry` or next safe gap below it
- `suggested_take_profit`: nearest major ask cluster or 1.5% above entry

**Insert into final output JSON**:
```json
{
  "suggested_entry": 101095.95,
  "suggested_stop_loss": 99985.00,
  "suggested_take_profit": 101129.00
}
ðŸ“Œ Ensure this is present whether or not liquidity zones were formally clustered.

2. Fix bid_depth_usdt and ask_depth_usdt in Final Output
Issue: Final output sometimes shows:

json
Copy
Edit
"bid_depth_usdt": 0.00,
"ask_depth_usdt": 0.00
Despite raw depth being parsed (e.g. 18.36M, 13.28M)

ðŸ§¹ Fix:

Preserve and reuse raw bid/ask depth values from order book analysis

If fallback structure is used, copy these directly

3. Reflect All Enhancements in Logging
Example log format:

yaml
Copy
Edit
ðŸ’§ Liquidity Decision: BUY (78%)
  - Suggested Entry: 101095.95
  - SL: 99985.00 | TP: 101129.00
  - Bid/Ask Depth: 18.36M / 13.28M
  - Reason: Extreme bid dominance at clustered support
ðŸ§ª Test Output Format (Expected)

{
  "action": "BUY",
  "confidence": 78,
  "reason": "Extreme buying pressure with strong bids at 101095.95 and thin ask walls above. Bid/ask ratio is 1.38.",

  "ask_depth_usdt": 13281910.00,
  "suggested_entry": 101095.95,
  "suggested_stop_loss": 99985.00,
