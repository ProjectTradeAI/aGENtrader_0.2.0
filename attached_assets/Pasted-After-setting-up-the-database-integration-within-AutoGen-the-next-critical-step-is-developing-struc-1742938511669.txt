After setting up the database integration within AutoGen, the next critical step is developing structured agentic decision-making sessions that consistently yield actionable trading decisions. Here's a clear, actionable guide to achieve that:

üéØ 1. Define Clear Trading Objectives per AutoGen Session:
Each AutoGen agent session must have clearly defined trading goals:
Session Objective Examples:


"Identify profitable short-term trades for BTC based on the latest market indicators."


"Determine if ETH‚Äôs current market conditions suggest buy, hold, or sell."


These explicit objectives will guide the agent's reasoning.

üìå 2. Structure Agent Roles in Decision Sessions:
Each AutoGen session typically involves multiple specialized agents collaborating:
Market Analyst Agent: Retrieves and analyzes real-time data (from SQL integration).


Strategy Manager Agent: Interprets analysis into actionable strategies.


Risk Management Agent: Validates trades against predefined risk parameters.


Trade Execution Agent: Finalizes and outputs the trading decision.
as an example.



üõ†Ô∏è 3. Clearly Define the Trading Decision Output Format:
To consistently automate execution, the final agent must deliver trading decisions in a structured, machine-readable format, such as JSON.
Recommended Decision Output Format (JSON example):


{
  "decision": "BUY",
  "asset": "BTC",
  "entry_price": 45300,
  "stop_loss": 44800,
  "take_profit": 46800,
  "confidence_score": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Bullish momentum confirmed by RSI and positive on-chain flows."
}

This ensures easy integration into downstream systems (execution platforms).
‚úÖ 4. Implement Structured Decision Extraction in AutoGen:
To automatically extract structured decisions reliably, implement a dedicated parser within AutoGen sessions:
Python example of structured extraction (within AutoGen workflow):
import json

def parse_agent_output(agent_response: str):
    try:
        decision_json = json.loads(agent_response)
        return decision_json
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Handle parsing failure, fallback mechanisms, etc.
        return {"error": "Failed to parse agent decision output."}

This ensures consistent and error-free automated execution.

üìà 5. Create a Decision Logging & Audit Trail:
Log all agent decisions for future auditing, improvement, and transparency.
import logging
logging.info(f"Agent trading decision: {decision_json}")

Store logs systematically, such as in an append-only database



‚öôÔ∏è 6. Integrate Decisions into Trading Execution Pipeline:
Integrate agent decisions directly into your trading execution pipeline (e.g., Binance API):



üìê Recommended AutoGen Session Configuration (Practical Tips):
Clearly define the system_message for each agent role within AutoGen.


Use structured prompts to enforce structured decision outputs.


Maintain concise communication between agents to prevent ambiguity and reduce complexity.


Example of a clear AutoGen agent definition:

trading_decision_agent = ConversableAgent(
    name="TradingDecisionAgent",
    system_message="""
    You are the final decision-maker agent. Summarize the inputs clearly, then issue one explicit trading decision in JSON format with the keys: decision (BUY/SELL/HOLD), asset, entry_price, stop_loss, take_profit, confidence_score, reasoning.
    """
)
