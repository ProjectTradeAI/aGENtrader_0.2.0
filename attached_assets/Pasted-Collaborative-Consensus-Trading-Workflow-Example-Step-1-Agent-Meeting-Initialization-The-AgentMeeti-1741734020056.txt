Step 1: Agent Meeting Initialization
The AgentMeetingCoordinator begins a trading discussion for Bitcoin (BTC):

==== Starting Agent Meeting #20250525_091530 at 2025-05-25T09:15:30 ====
-- Discussion for BTC --
Step 2: Market Analysis Presentation
Market Analysis Agent: For BTC, I'm observing a bullish trend with 78% confidence. Current price is $52,347.85. Technical indicators suggest buy. I've identified support at $50,928.33 and resistance at $53,651.92. Key indicators: MACD: bullish crossover, RSI: 62.5 (neutral), Bollinger Bands: price near upper band.
Step 3: Sentiment Analysis Presentation
Sentiment Analysis Agent: Social sentiment for BTC is positive with a score of 0.72. News analysis shows very positive sentiment. Based on sentiment alone, I would suggest a buy action with 75% confidence.
Step 4: Liquidity Analysis Presentation
Liquidity Analysis Agent: Liquidity for BTC has a score of 82.3/100. Estimated slippage for standard orders would be 0.15%. Order book depth analysis indicates a buy bias. I've identified key liquidity zones at 50925.45, 49876.20, 48754.30 (support) and 53125.75, 54350.25, 55782.60 (resistance).

Exchange outflows exceed inflows by 28%, suggesting coins are moving to cold storage. MVRV ratio at 1.8 indicates reasonable valuation.
Step 6: Strategy Manager Deliberation
Strategy Manager Agent: After evaluating all inputs for BTC, I'm selecting the RSI_Trend_Following strategy with a medium risk profile. This strategy is recommending a buy signal with 82% confidence. Reasoning: Multiple agent signals align (technical, sentiment, on-chain) with favorable liquidity conditions.
Step 7: Trade Execution Feedback

This workflow demonstrates how your agents work together through structured communication, each providing specialized analysis that feeds into a consensus-driven decision. The AgentMeetingCoordinator facilitates discussions while the WorkflowOrchestrator ensures that decisions are implemented through the proper agent channels, resulting in concrete trading actions with appropriate risk management parameters.

The system creates multiple validation layers through different analytical perspectives (technical, sentiment, liquidity, on-chain) before committing to a trading decision, significantly enhancing decision quality through multi-agent consensus.
