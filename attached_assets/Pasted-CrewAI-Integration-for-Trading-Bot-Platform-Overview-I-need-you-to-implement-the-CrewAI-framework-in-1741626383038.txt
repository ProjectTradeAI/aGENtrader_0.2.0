CrewAI Integration for Trading Bot Platform
Overview
I need you to implement the CrewAI framework into our existing trading bot platform to enhance our multi-agent system. The goal is to leverage CrewAI's collaborative agent capabilities to improve decision-making and communication between our specialized trading agents.

Current Implementation
We've created a prototype in agents/crewai_prototype.py that demonstrates how CrewAI can work with our trading system. I need your help to:

Build upon this prototype to create a production-ready implementation
Integrate it with our existing agent architecture
Enable agent "meetings" where specialized agents can collaborate on trading decisions
Key Requirements
Initially focus only on the BTCUSDT trading pair
Use the existing specialized agents (market analysis, liquidity analysis, strategy manager, trade execution)
Implement a structured meeting process where agents share analysis, debate options, and reach consensus
Ensure the implementation is compatible with our web interface for displaying agent communications
Create a clear, modular design that can be easily extended later
Integrate with our existing data sources and storage
Structure Needed
A central CrewAI manager class that handles agent creation and orchestration
Integration with our agent_controller.py to replace or enhance the existing meeting functionality
Methods to translate agent outputs into standardized formats for our UI
Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
Clear documentation of the new architecture
Technical Guidelines
Build on the prototype in agents/crewai_prototype.py
Follow the multi-agent meeting approach shown in orchestration/agent_meeting.py
Make the system work with minimal external API usage (fallback to local models when possible)
Maintain compatibility with our existing data structures and logging
Ensure the implementation can be tested in isolation before full integration
Expected Deliverables
Updated CrewAI implementation that integrates with our platform
Modifications to necessary orchestration files
Tests demonstrating the functionality
Documentation explaining the architecture and how to use it
Please help implement this integration in a way that preserves our existing functionality while enhancing our agent collaboration capabilities.
