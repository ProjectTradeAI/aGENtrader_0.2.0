CrewAI Migration Roadmap: Incremental Approach
Based on your codebase, I understand your goal to transition from your custom orchestration architecture to using CrewAI as the core orchestration layer. Here's why an incremental approach makes sense and a roadmap for implementation:

Why Incremental Migration is Recommended
Risk Mitigation: A gradual transition allows you to validate each workflow in CrewAI before fully committing, reducing the risk of system-wide failures.

Learning Curve: Your team can get comfortable with CrewAI's patterns and best practices on simpler workflows before tackling the more complex ones.

Parallel Validation: Running both systems simultaneously lets you compare results and ensure consistency before fully switching over.

Business Continuity: Your trading system continues operating without interruption during the migration process.

Feedback Loop: Each migrated workflow provides insights that can improve subsequent migrations.

Proposed Migration Roadmap
Phase 1: Preparatory Work (Current Stage)
Refine your existing CrewAIManager implementation
Develop metrics collection to compare performance between systems
Create integration tests that validate behavior equivalence
Phase 2: Single-Symbol Analysis Migration
Migrate the market analysis workflow for BTCUSDT
Run both systems in parallel, comparing outputs
Adjust CrewAI task templates and agent configurations based on findings
Phase 3: Strategy Selection Migration
Move strategy selection logic to CrewAI
Integrate with existing market analysis components
Validate decision quality against your current system
Phase 4: Trade Execution Integration
Connect CrewAI's strategy outputs to your execution layer
Implement safeguards and validation checks
Run in "shadow mode" (generate recommendations but don't execute trades)
Phase 5: Full Workflow Migration
Migrate remaining workflows
Develop comprehensive monitoring
Fully transition once performance and reliability metrics meet requirements
Phase 6: Legacy System Retirement
Archive custom orchestration components
Optimize CrewAI implementation
Implement new features previously constrained by your custom architecture
