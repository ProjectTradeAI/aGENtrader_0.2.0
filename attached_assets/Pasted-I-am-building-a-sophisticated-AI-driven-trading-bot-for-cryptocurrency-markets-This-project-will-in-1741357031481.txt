I am building a sophisticated AI-driven trading bot for cryptocurrency markets. This project will involve the use of multiple **AI agents** to analyze market data, optimize portfolios, evaluate trading strategies, and manage trades autonomously. I need Replit to assist me in setting up the entire project environment, creating the necessary files, and structuring the project in a clear, organized way that will help facilitate development.

Here are the main goals and requirements for this project:

### **Project Goals:**
1. **AI-driven trading bot** to manage cryptocurrency trades.
2. **Multiple agents**:
   - **Market Analysis Agent**: Analyzes real-time market data.
   - **Quantum Optimization Agent**: Uses quantum-inspired algorithms for portfolio optimization.
   - **Sentiment Analysis Agent**: Analyzes social media and news sentiment.
   - **Trade Execution Agent**: Executes trades based on strategies.

3. **Data Management**: Includes data storage for market trends, backtesting results, and logs.
4. **Deployment**: The bot should be deployed to an EC2 instance (not within Replit) for real-time trading.

### **Environment Setup**:
1. Create a **virtual environment** with Python 3.
2. Install necessary libraries such as `openai`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`.
3. Add a **requirements.txt** for dependencies.
4. Set up **API keys and configuration files** for external services (Binance, TradingView, etc.).

### **File Structure**:
Replit should create the following directory structure:

/project_root
│── /agents
│   ├── market_analysis.py  # For market analysis
│   ├── quantum_optimizer.py # For quantum-inspired portfolio optimization
│   ├── sentiment_analysis.py # For sentiment analysis
│   ├── strategy_evaluator.py # For backtesting strategies
│   ├── trade_execution.py # For executing trades
│
│── /assistants
│   ├── research_assistant.py # For gathering market insights
│   ├── project_manager.py # For managing tasks, schedules, and workflows
│   ├── documentation_assistant.py # For assisting with documentation updates
│
│── /orchestration
│   ├── agent_controller.py # For coordinating agent communication and tasks
│   ├── event_manager.py # For handling triggers and events between agents
│   ├── task_scheduler.py # For managing agent execution timing
│
│── /deployment
│   ├── ec2_setup.sh # Automates EC2 setup for the bot
│   ├── deploy.py # Deploys the bot from Replit to EC2
│
│── /data
│   ├── market_data.json # For storing market data
│   ├── backtest_results.csv # For storing backtest results
│   ├── logs/ # For storing logs and agent execution details
│
│── /config
│   ├── settings.json # For storing API keys and trading parameters
│   ├── replit_config.py # For Replit-specific configuration
│   ├── ec2_config.py # For EC2 deployment-specific settings
│
│── main.py # The main file to initiate and run the agents
│── README.md # Documentation
│── requirements.txt # Dependency management
│── .gitignore # For ignoring unnecessary files
│── Dockerfile # Optional for containerized deployment

### **Replit’s Task List:**
1. Set up the file structure as described.
2. Create necessary **boilerplate code** for each Python file, with basic imports, agent class definitions, and comments.
3. Set up the **virtual environment** and install dependencies like `openai`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `requests`.
4. Add **GitHub integration** for version control, including `.gitignore` for ignoring unnecessary files.
5. Provide **guidance for workflow** and **project management**—set up tabs for coding, testing, logs, and coordination. Suggest how agents can interact, and provide suggestions for tab organization.

### **Special Requirements**:
- **Organize the project for future scalability**, ensuring that new agents can be added easily.
- Keep everything **modular** so the agents and assistants can be easily managed and improved.
