Next, let's significantly enhance the robustness and resilience of the aGENtrader v2 system through comprehensive error handling and validation across all critical pipeline components.

### ðŸš¦ **Goals:**
- Graceful handling and logging of all exceptions and errors.
- Prevention of unexpected system crashes.
- Improved reliability and readiness for live trading conditions.

### ðŸ“Œ **Tasks:**

#### **1. Enhance Error Handling in Analyst Agents (Liquidity, Technical, Sentiment):**
- Handle external API/data fetching errors explicitly:
  - Log API connection failures clearly (ERROR level).
  - Implement intelligent retry logic (up to 3 retries with exponential backoff).
  - If retries fail, raise a clear exception or flag and log critical issue.
- Remove silent fallback to mock data in live mode. Instead:
  - Log a critical warning clearly stating data is unavailable.
  - Prevent further analysis unless configured explicitly (`allow_mock_fallback: true`).

#### **2. Robustness in PortfolioManagerAgent, RiskGuardAgent, PositionSizerAgent:**
- Validate incoming trade decision data carefully:
  - Reject and log clearly if input is malformed or missing required fields.
- Wrap all calculations in try-except blocks to handle unexpected exceptions:
  - Log the exact cause and stack trace if an exception occurs.
  - Gracefully handle errors by rejecting the trade with clear explanation.

#### **3. TradeExecutorAgent Robustness:**
- Simulate realistic execution errors (e.g., network errors, latency issues):
  - Implement error scenarios randomly in simulation mode to test handling.
- Catch all exceptions during trade execution attempts:
  - Log clear error messages and reasons for trade execution failures.
  - Store failed trades clearly for manual inspection later (`logs/failed_trades.jsonl`).

#### **4. Global Exception Handling in CoreOrchestrator:**
- Wrap the entire orchestration pipeline execution in try-except:
  - Catch and log any unexpected runtime exceptions with full stack traces.
  - Ensure exceptions do not crash the entire pipeline, and log clearly.

#### **5. Configurable Error Handling Settings (`settings.yaml`):**
Add these settings:
```yaml
error_handling:
  max_api_retries: 3
  retry_backoff_seconds: 2
  allow_mock_fallback: false
  log_failed_trades: true
