Next, let's significantly enhance the robustness and resilience of the aGENtrader v2 system through comprehensive error handling and validation across all critical pipeline components.

### ðŸš¦ **Goals:**
- Graceful handling and logging of all exceptions and errors.
- Prevention of unexpected system crashes.
- Improved reliability and readiness for live trading conditions.

### ðŸ“Œ **Tasks:**

#### **1. Enhance Error Handling in Analyst Agents (Liquidity, Technical, Sentiment):**
- Handle external API/data fetching errors explicitly:
  - Log API connection failures clearly (ERROR level).
  - Implement intelligent retry logic (up to 3 retries with exponential backoff).
  - If retries fail, raise a clear exception or flag and log critical issue.
- Remove silent fallback to mock data in live mode. Instead:
  - Log a critical warning clearly stating data is unavailable.
  - Prevent further analysis unless configured explicitly (`allow_mock_fallback: true`).

#### **2. Robustness in PortfolioManagerAgent, RiskGuardAgent, PositionSizerAgent:**
- Validate incoming trade decision data carefully:
  - Reject and log clearly if input is malformed or missing required fields.
- Wrap all calculations in try-except blocks to handle unexpected exceptions:
  - Log the exact cause and stack trace if an exception occurs.
  - Gracefully handle errors by rejecting the trade with clear explanation.

#### **3. TradeExecutorAgent Robustness:**
- Simulate realistic execution errors (e.g., network errors, latency issues):
  - Implement error scenarios randomly in simulation mode to test handling.
- Catch all exceptions during trade execution attempts:
  - Log clear error messages and reasons for trade execution failures.
  - Store failed trades clearly for manual inspection later (`logs/failed_trades.jsonl`).

#### **4. Global Exception Handling in CoreOrchestrator:**
- Wrap the entire orchestration pipeline execution in try-except:
  - Catch and log any unexpected runtime exceptions with full stack traces.
  - Ensure exceptions do not crash the entire pipeline, and log clearly.

#### **5. Configurable Error Handling Settings (`settings.yaml`):**
Add these settings:
```yaml
error_handling:
  max_api_retries: 3
  retry_backoff_seconds: 2
  allow_mock_fallback: false
  log_failed_trades: true
6. Clear Logging:
Ensure all error conditions are logged with explicit severity (ERROR/CRITICAL).

Maintain uniform log structure: timestamp, component name, error type, detailed reason.

7. Validation and Testing:
Create thorough test cases (tests/test_error_handling.py) for each agent to simulate error scenarios:

Missing API data, malformed inputs, calculation errors.

Simulate and validate pipeline behavior when errors occur.

Document error handling clearly in ERROR_HANDLING.md.

ðŸ“Œ Acceptance Criteria:
System gracefully handles all expected error scenarios without crashing.

Detailed logs clearly explain every error, retry, or rejection.

Mock fallback behavior is disabled in live mode by default, but configurable.

Trade execution failures and other critical errors are saved clearly for debugging.
