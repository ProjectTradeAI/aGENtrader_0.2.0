Now that all `agen_trader` and `agentrader` references have been renamed to `aGENtrader`, please SSH into the EC2 instance and complete the following post-standardization tasks to ensure the system is fully updated, running, and stable.
---
### 🔐 SSH Configuration
Use the secrets provided (`EC2_KEY`, `EC2_USER`, `EC2_PUBLIC_IP`) to connect to the EC2 instance securely.

---

## ✅ Deployment Tasks

### 🗂️ 1. Rename the EC2 Project Directory
- Rename the old working directory:
  ```bash
  mv ~/agentrader ~/aGENtrader
Update any deployment scripts and scheduled tasks (e.g. @reboot cronjob) to use:

@reboot cd /home/ubuntu/aGENtrader && docker-compose up -d
🐳 2. Rebuild and Restart Docker Container
Navigate to the updated path:
cd ~/aGENtrader
Rebuild and restart the Docker container using the updated name:
docker-compose down
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
🔍 3. Verify System Functionality
Run:
docker ps | grep aGENtrader
docker logs -f aGENtrader
Confirm:

Container is running and stable

Real data is being fetched

Trading decisions are logged to trades/ and reports/

Logs reflect correct branding (e.g., aGENtrader in tags)

📂 4. Validate Volume Mounts
Ensure folders are correctly mapped and persistent:
ls ~/aGENtrader/logs
ls ~/aGENtrader/trades
ls ~/aGENtrader/reports
🧹 5. Clean Up Old Docker Artifacts (Optional but Recommended)
docker image rm agentrader || true
docker container prune -f
docker volume prune -f
🔁 6. Test Reboot Persistence (Optional)
Add or verify the following crontab line:
@reboot cd /home/ubuntu/aGENtrader && docker-compose up -d
Reboot the instance and confirm:
sudo reboot
After reboot:
docker ps
docker logs -f aGENtrader
📄 7. Report Back
Provide a summary:

Confirmation of directory rename

Docker image status

Last 10 log lines from container

Any warnings, errors, or skipped steps

✅ Acceptance Criteria:
The aGENtrader brand is now used consistently across container names, logs, folders, and scripts

Docker container is live and stable on EC2

Volumes persist, and logs are collected

Reboot persistence is configured and tested
