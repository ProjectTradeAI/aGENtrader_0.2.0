Now that the aGENtrader v2 system is Dockerized and the new EC2 instance is ready (launched from a pre-configured AMI), please SSH into the EC2 instance and perform the following full deployment steps.

### üîê Environment Setup (via Replit Secrets)
Use the following stored secrets for SSH access:
- `EC2_PUBLIC_IP`: Public IP or hostname of the EC2 instance
- `EC2_KEY`: SSH private key
---

## ‚úÖ Deployment Goals:
- Deploy the Dockerized aGENtrader v2 system on EC2
- Start live paper-trading simulation (in background)
- Validate that the system runs and logs correctly
- Set up startup automation for persistence across EC2 reboots
---

## üìå Tasks:
### 1. SSH Into the EC2 Instance
- Use secure SSH connection based on stored secrets

### 2. Prepare the Project Directory
- Navigate to or create the directory: `~/aGENtrader`
- If not already cloned, run:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ProjectTradeAI/aGENtrader.git
  cd aGENtrader/aGENtrader_v2
3. Deploy the Docker System
Run:
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
4. Validate Successful Deployment
Run docker ps and ensure the agen_trader container is running

Tail logs with docker logs -f agen_trader or docker-compose logs -f

Check that:

All agents initialize successfully

Real data is being fetched (CoinAPI, etc.)

Trade decisions and executions are logged

No errors or crash loops occur

5. Set Up Startup Automation
Ensure aGENtrader restarts after system reboot:

Add a cron job using:
crontab -e
Add this line to start on reboot:
@reboot cd /home/ubuntu/aGENtrader/aGENtrader_v2 && /usr/bin/docker-compose up -d
Make sure /usr/bin/docker-compose path matches Docker Compose location (which docker-compose)

Alternatively, if preferred:

Set up systemd service to run Docker Compose on boot

6. Post-Deployment Report
Print confirmation that:
System is running
Logs are being generated
Auto-start is configured
Document steps taken and any issues encountered

üìÅ Optional:
Save and log EC2 logs from /logs/ and /reports/ into mounted volumes

Provide restart commands for quick reference

üß† Acceptance Criteria:
Container is running in detached mode
System fetches live market data and simulates trades
Logs and decisions persist
System auto-starts after reboot without manual intervention
