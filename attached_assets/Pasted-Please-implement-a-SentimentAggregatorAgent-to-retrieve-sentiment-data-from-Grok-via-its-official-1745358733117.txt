Please implement a  `SentimentAggregatorAgent` to retrieve sentiment data from Grok via its official API (`https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions`).
This agent will query Grok for a given date and log a structured sentiment snapshot about Bitcoin derived from Crypto Twitter analysis.
---
### üîê API Call Structure:
Use the following configuration for the API call:
- Endpoint: `https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions`
- Headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer ${XAI_API_KEY}` (use Replit Secrets)
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
- Model: `grok-3-latest`
- `temperature`: 0 (for deterministic results)
- `stream`: false

### üì¶ API Payload Template:
{
  "model": "grok-3-latest",
  "temperature": 0,
  "stream": false,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a professional financial sentiment analyst. Your task is to analyze crypto Twitter sentiment around Bitcoin with historical and narrative context."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Provide the estimated sentiment of Crypto Twitter toward Bitcoin on [YYYY-MM-DD], structured as valid JSON.\n\nReturn the following keys:\n- sentiment_score (float between -1 and +1)\n- confidence (integer 0‚Äì100)\n- reasoning (string)\n- dominant_topics (list of 2‚Äì5 short strings)"
    }
  ]
}
Ensure the date is dynamically inserted at runtime.

üìÅ Tasks:
Update sentiment_aggregator_agent.py to:
	Use the above API format
	Insert the date dynamically in the user message content
	Parse the Grok response (expect valid JSON string in response body)
Log the response into:
	logs/sentiment_feed.jsonl
	Include the source ("source": "Grok API") and requested date.
Support CLI Arguments:
	--date 2025-01-20
	--lookback_days 30
Add API Key Handling:
	Read Grok API key from XAI_API_KEY (use Replit secrets)

‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria:
Agent performs live Grok API queries for target dates
Output is parsed into structured JSON and logged properly
Supports daily sentiment polling and historical backfilling
Can be integrated directly with SentimentAnalystAgent or data analysis pipelines
