Please replace the placeholder/mock logic in the TechnicalAnalystAgent with real technical analysis indicators using the OHLCV market data already fetched.

### âœ… Goals:
- Generate actual trade signals based on established technical indicators.
- Output structured decisions with dynamically calculated confidence scores.
- Increase responsiveness of the system to real-time market conditions.

---

### ðŸ“Œ Tasks:

#### 1. **Add Real Technical Indicators Using ta-lib or pandas_ta**
- Use `pandas_ta` (recommended for Replit/EC2 environments due to easier setup) to compute:
  - **EMA crossover** (e.g., 20 EMA vs 50 EMA)
  - **RSI** (default: 14 periods)
  - Optionally: MACD, Bollinger Bands, Volume Spike Detection

#### 2. **Generate Action Signals**
- Define a signal rule set like:
```python
if ema_20 > ema_50 and rsi < 70:
    action = "BUY"
elif ema_20 < ema_50 and rsi > 30:
    action = "SELL"
else:
    action = "HOLD"
3. Calculate Dynamic Confidence Score
Example:

Confidence based on RSI distance from threshold:

confidence = 50 + abs(rsi - 50) / 50 * 50
Or:

Use weighted scoring from multiple indicators.

4. Update Output Format
Return standard agent decision format:

{
  "agent": "TechnicalAnalystAgent",
  "signal": "BUY",
  "confidence": 74,
  "reason": "EMA 20 crossed above EMA 50; RSI = 55.4"
}
5. Ensure Integration Works with DecisionAgent
Confirm output is structured as expected

Test locally to ensure outputs vary as market structure changes

6. Optional Enhancements
Log all indicators to logs/indicators.jsonl for visual tracking

Plot decision logic for manual inspection (e.g., generate plots in reports/)

ðŸ§ª Requirements
Ensure pandas_ta is added to requirements.txt and imported in the agent:

âœ… Acceptance Criteria:
TechnicalAnalystAgent no longer uses static or mock logic.
Decisions are based on at least 2 real technical indicators.
Confidence scores are calculated dynamically and vary by market conditions.
System successfully transitions from HOLD-only decisions to meaningful BUY/SELL opportunities.
