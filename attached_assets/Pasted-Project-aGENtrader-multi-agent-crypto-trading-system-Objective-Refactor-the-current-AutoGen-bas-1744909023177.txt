Project: aGENtrader (multi-agent crypto trading system)

Objective:
Refactor the current AutoGen-based agent system to use **AutoGen Core** instead of AgentChat for better orchestration control and extensibility.

Key Goals:
1. Migrate at least one agent (e.g., `liquidity_analyst_agent.py`) to AutoGen Core using the event-based agent model.
2. Integrate **local LLM support** using `autogen_ext.models.ollama.OllamaChatCompletionClient` (with a placeholder model like "mistral" or "codellama").
3. Use `autogen_ext.executors.PythonCodeExecutor` inside that agent to simulate a DB access or computation module (e.g., to fetch and evaluate order book liquidity).
4. Modularize the agent logic so other agents can be migrated similarly.
5. Preserve compatibility with the existing orchestrator (`collaborative_trading_framework.py`) or create a new orchestrator based on `AgentGroup` or custom event loop using `AutoGen Core`.

Directory: `agents/`
Agent to refactor first: `liquidity_analyst_agent.py`

Tools Provided:
- Python (assume Replit environment with internet & pip access)
- Ability to install `autogen`, `autogen-ext`, `ollama` or other necessary packages
- Access to shared modules in `utils/`, `shared/`, and `orchestration/`

Important:
- Keep agent role & objective the same
- Output should be modular (separate class or function)
- Add comments for each significant change
- Use mock response or test payload if real data not available
- Use environment variables or config for API/model configs
- Make sure the agent logs events or states for future decision history

Stretch Goals (if time permits):
- Implement a prototype orchestrator using `AutoGen Core` event loop
- Demonstrate agent-to-agent messaging using AutoGen Core
- Add simple caching or memory logging layer using SQLite or file

Once this agent is working, I will replicate the same architecture to `on_chain_analysis.py`, `sentiment_analysis.py`, and others.

Start by listing the necessary dependency changes, code refactors, and architecture plan, then begin implementing step-by-step.
