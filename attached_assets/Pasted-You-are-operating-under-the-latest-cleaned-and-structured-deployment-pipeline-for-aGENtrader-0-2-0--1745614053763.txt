You are operating under the latest cleaned and structured deployment pipeline for aGENtrader_0.2.0.

Your next task is to perform a full EC2 cleanup and fresh redeployment, ensuring that the entire deployment system works exactly as intended with no legacy data or leftover artifacts.

---

### 🎯 Objectives:

✅ Wipe existing Docker containers, images, and volumes  
✅ Remove old repo folders or cached files  
✅ (Optional) If needed, reset EC2 instance to a new one  
✅ Clone fresh codebase from GitHub (main branch, v0.2.0 tag or latest commit)  
✅ Build Docker image cleanly using new scripts  
✅ Start containers  
✅ Validate system health with `validate_deployment.py`

---

### 📁 Tasks:

#### 1. SSH into EC2
Use stored secrets (`EC2_HOST`, `EC2_USER`, `EC2_SSH_KEY`).

---

#### 2. Full Docker Cleanup
Run:
```bash
docker system prune -a --volumes -f
This removes:

All stopped containers

All unused images

All volumes

All networks

3. Remove Old Repo Folder
If ~/aGENtrader/ exists:

bash
Copy
Edit
rm -rf ~/aGENtrader/
4. (Optional) Reset EC2 Instance
If desired, terminate the current EC2 instance

Launch a new EC2 instance with identical settings (region, type, etc.)

Reconnect via new IP and SSH key

5. Fresh Repo Clone
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone git@github.com:ProjectTradeAI/aGENtrader_0.2.0.git ~/aGENtrader
cd ~/aGENtrader
git checkout main
6. Build and Deploy Using Centralized Scripts
bash
Copy
Edit
bash deployment/build_image.sh
bash deployment/deploy_ec2.sh
Confirm:

Image builds cleanly

Docker container starts

Correct Git version/tag is displayed inside container logs

7. Run Deployment Validation
Inside EC2:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 deployment/validate_deployment.py
Check:

Binance Data Provider initialized

DecisionAgent active

Logging to logs/decision_summary.logl

Agents making decisions successfully

✅ Acceptance Criteria:
EC2 running fresh, clean aGENtrader deployment

Docker container using correct version tag (e.g., v0.2.0)

Logs created correctly (decisions, trades, sentiment)

Health validation passed

No artifacts from older deployments present

(Optional) Ready to tag this deployment as v0.2.1-alpha
