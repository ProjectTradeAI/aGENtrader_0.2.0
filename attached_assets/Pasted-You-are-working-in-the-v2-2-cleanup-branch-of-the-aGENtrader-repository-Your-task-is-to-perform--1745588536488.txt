You are working in the `v2.2-cleanup` branch of the aGENtrader repository.

Your task is to perform a complete repository cleanup and workspace sanitization.

The goal is to remove any outdated, unused, test-related, or Replit-specific files and scripts that are cluttering the workspace, confusing the system, or contributing to failed deployments.

---

## ‚úÖ Key Directives:

### 1. Clean Up Replit-Specific & Local-Only Files
Remove (if present):
.replit replit.nix *.sqlite3 *.swp *.DS_Store *.pkl .nix/ tmp/

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

### 2. Remove Unused or Outdated Scripts
- Audit the `scripts/` folder
- Move outdated/untested/experimental scripts to `archive/scripts_legacy/`
- Only keep scripts that are:
  - Actively used in deployment
  - Data analysis tools (`view_performance.py`, `view_open_trades.py`, etc.)
  - Dataset generation and log inspection

Preserve:
scripts/git_sync.sh scripts/export_decision_dataset.py scripts/view_open_trades.py scripts/view_performance.py

yaml
Copy
Edit

Move to archive or delete if:
- No longer used in current system
- Created for one-off testing
- Not tied to any agent or task

---

### 3. Remove Redundant Docker or Deployment Files
Only preserve Docker-related files in:
docker/ docker-compose.yml docker-entrypoint.sh deployment/

yaml
Copy
Edit

Remove or move to archive:
- Older Dockerfiles no longer used (e.g., `Dockerfile.legacy`, `Dockerfile.test`)
- Unused deployment experiments

---

### 4. Remove Log Clutter & Artifacts
Delete all temporary, auto-generated logs from:
logs/ datasets/ (except actual exports) tests/ (except real unit test files)

yaml
Copy
Edit

Exclude:
- `logs/.gitkeep` if needed to preserve folder structure
- Real datasets used for training

---

### 5. Update .gitignore to Include:
Logs & temp files
logs/ *.log *.jsonl

Replit & editor files
.replit *.swp *.DS_Store .vscode/ .idea/

Python artifacts
pycache/ *.pyc *.pyo

System artifacts
tmp/ .env .env.*

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

### üóÉÔ∏è 6. Archive Anything You‚Äôre Unsure About
Move anything questionable to:
archive/unverified_scripts/ archive/misc_backups/

yaml
Copy
Edit

Nothing should be deleted permanently unless it's clearly junk.

---

### ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria:
- Repo is fully cleaned up and ready for deployment
- No leftover test logs, junk files, or dev-only experiments
- `.gitignore` is fully updated
- Only production-ready and actively used scripts are left in `scripts/`
- Archive contains non-destructive backups of anything uncertain
