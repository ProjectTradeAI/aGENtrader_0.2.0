You are working under the `main` branch of the aGENtrader_0.2.0 repository.

Your task is to enhance branding consistency and polish the developer experience across all CLI logs and automated scripts.

---

### üéØ Objectives

‚úÖ Ensure the current system version (e.g., `v2.2.0`) is correctly shown in:

- Dev cycle log headers
- Docker build banner
- Deployment summary logs
- Validation output
- Decision logs (optional)

‚úÖ Insert an ASCII logo at the top of dev logs (preferably colorized using ANSI escape codes)

‚úÖ Centralize branding version so it can be updated in one place

---

### üìÅ Tasks

#### 1. Define a Central Version Constant

In a file like `core/version.py`, define:
```python
VERSION = "v2.2.0"
‚úÖ All other scripts should import from here, including run.py, build_image.sh, validate_deployment.py

2. Sync Branding Usage
Update all places that currently show version v2.0.2 or older to dynamically use:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -c "from core.version import VERSION; print(VERSION)"
or in Bash (if parsed from a .txt or .env file)

3. Insert ASCII Logo into scripts/dev_cycle.sh
Add the previously generated logo as a function (e.g., print_logo) at the top of scripts/dev_cycle.sh

Use ANSI escape codes to colorize:

bash
Copy
Edit
\e[38;5;208m   ‚Çø‚Çø‚Çø   ‚Çø‚Çø‚Çø‚Çø‚Çø ...
‚úÖ Display logo + current version immediately after:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo -e "aGENtrader - Version: $(python3 -c 'from core.version import VERSION; print(VERSION)')"
‚úÖ Ensure logo only prints once and doesn‚Äôt clutter logs repeatedly.

4. Update Docker Build and Deploy Logs
At the top of each output:

Add logo (optional)

Add version banner using shared version constant

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "aGENtrader $(VERSION) - Docker Build Start"
‚úÖ Helps trace log output to exact version deployed.

5. Optional: Add Branding Footer
At end of successful deploy or validation:

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "‚úÖ aGENtrader $(VERSION) deployment complete"
‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
Version number appears consistently across all scripts and outputs

ASCII logo is visible at top of dev_cycle.sh log

Docker builds and validations reflect current version correctly

Version can be upgraded in one place (core/version.py) and reflected everywhere
