You are working under the `main` branch of the aGENtrader_0.2.0 repository.

Your task is to fully diagnose, fix, and validate the deployment pipeline to ensure that development updates flow seamlessly from Replit → GitHub → EC2 → Dockerized production system.

---

### 🎯 Objectives:

✅ Ensure Replit can:
- Commit and push to GitHub without permission errors
- Pull latest changes into EC2 securely

✅ Ensure EC2 can:
- Authenticate with GitHub (SSH deploy key or personal token method)
- Pull latest Git commits
- Rebuild and restart Docker containers from the updated code

✅ Validate:
- Docker is running the correct code version
- System health check passes (Binance data connected, agents active, logs writing)

---

### 🛠️ Tasks:

#### 1. Fix GitHub Push from Replit
- Confirm SSH key exists for Replit Git access:
  - If missing, generate new SSH keypair inside Replit and add public key to GitHub repo deploy keys (with Write permission).
- Confirm `.git/config` uses `git@github.com:ProjectTradeAI/aGENtrader_0.2.0.git` format, not HTTPS.

#### 2. Fix GitHub Pull from EC2
- Confirm EC2 can authenticate with GitHub:
  - Check if `/home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa` exists and has correct private key.
  - Add GitHub to known_hosts:
    ```bash
    ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
    ```

#### 3. Update `deployment/deploy_ec2.sh`
- Modify script to:
  - SSH into EC2 using secrets
  - Run:
    ```bash
    cd ~/aGENtrader
    git pull origin main
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose build --no-cache
    docker-compose up -d
    ```
  - Print deployment success summary

#### 4. Implement Docker Image Versioning
- Modify `build_image.sh` and `docker-compose.yml` to tag Docker images using Git tags like:
agen_trader:v0.2.0

yaml
Copy
Edit

#### 5. Validate Deployment
- After `docker-compose up`, execute `deployment/validate_deployment.py`
- Validate:
- BinanceDataProvider initialized
- DecisionAgent started
- Log files (e.g., decision_summary.logl) updated

---

### 📄 Additional Artifacts to Update
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (brief instructions on push-pull-deploy)
- `.ssh/config` (optional convenience for multiple EC2 instances)

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria:
- Replit can push cleanly to GitHub without manual intervention
- EC2 can pull cleanly from GitHub via SSH
- Docker containers are version-tagged and updated correctly
- After deployment, validate_deployment.py passes all checks
- System logs confirm agent activity without errors
