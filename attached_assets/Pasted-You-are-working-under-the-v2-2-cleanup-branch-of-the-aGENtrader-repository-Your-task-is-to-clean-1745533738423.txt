You are working under the `v2.2-cleanup` branch of the aGENtrader repository.

Your task is to clean up and restructure the repository to follow a professional-grade project layout. This will improve maintainability, ease of collaboration, and reduce confusion for future tasks.

---

### 🎯 Objective:
Organize all existing code, scripts, data, agents, and Docker files into a clear, modular directory structure while preserving any useful legacy content.

---

### 📁 Target Directory Structure:

Restructure the repo as follows:
aGENtrader/ ├── agents/ # All agent classes and logic ├── analytics/ # Trade tracking, performance scoring, dataset exports ├── core/ # Orchestrators, triggers, routers, system coordination ├── config/ # YAML config files, .env.example ├── data/ # Market data utilities and providers (Binance, CoinAPI, etc.) ├── docker/ # Dockerfiles, Docker build scripts ├── datasets/ # Training-ready or exported datasets ├── deployment/ # EC2 deployment scripts and setup instructions ├── logs/ # All runtime and strategy logs ├── scripts/ # CLI utilities, tests, and validators ├── tests/ # Unit or integration tests ├── main.py # System entry point ├── docker-compose.yml ├── requirements.txt ├── README.md

### 🗃️ Legacy Code Handling:
- Move unused, redundant, or deprecated files into:
archive/aGENtrader_v2.1/

- Tag this cleanup point as `v2.1.legacy` before starting, then push to `v2.2-cleanup`.

### ✅ Implementation Tasks:
1. Move all current agent files into `agents/`
2. Move performance and export logic into `analytics/`
3. Move market data modules into `data/`
4. Move all config and settings files into `config/`
5. Move Dockerfiles, build scripts into `docker/`
6. Move reusable CLI scripts into `scripts/`
7. Preserve logs and output files into `logs/`
8. Create `datasets/` folder for exports
9. Keep `main.py`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `README.md` at the root level

---

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria:
- Repo follows the new structure and is free from unorganized legacy clutter
- All current functionality is preserved
- Legacy code and deprecated scripts are moved to `archive/aGENtrader_v2.1/`
- Git history is preserved; commit and push changes to `v2.2-cleanup`
- Tag the pre-cleanup state as `v2.1.legacy`

⚠️ DO NOT delete any files. Everything must be either moved to its new location or preserved in the `archive/` directory.
