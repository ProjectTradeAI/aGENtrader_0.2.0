You‚Äôre working under the `v2.1-dev` branch of aGENtrader.

Please initiate a full test run to validate that the system is operating end-to-end with the following modules fully integrated:

- Binance market data
- Timeframe consistency
- DecisionTriggerScheduler
- TradeBookManager
- RiskGuardAgent
- PositionSizerAgent
- TradePerformanceTracker
- SentimentAggregatorAgent (if activated)
- decision_logger + export_decision_dataset pipeline

---

## ‚úÖ Test Objectives

1. Run a live or simulated test of aGENtrader for 1-2 trading cycles
2. Verify that each module contributes correctly to trade execution
3. Confirm that logs are produced and contain expected insights
4. Export a mini training dataset from the session for inspection

---

### üìÅ Tasks

#### 1. Start Test Run
- Use `docker-compose up` inside a `screen` session (or local script)
- Run at least 1 full decision cycle (~aligned with interval = 1h)

#### 2. Observe Logs in Real-Time
Check:
- `logs/decision_summary.logl` ‚Üí summarized natural language decisions
- `logs/trade_book.jsonl` ‚Üí recorded trade activity
- `logs/trade_performance.jsonl` ‚Üí simulated results
- `logs/rejected_trades.jsonl` ‚Üí any vetoed trades with reason

#### 3. Extract Training Dataset
Run:
```bash
python scripts/export_decision_dataset.py --limit 100
Confirm output files:

datasets/decision_log_dataset.csv

datasets/decision_log_dataset.jsonl

Each entry should include:

Agent name

Timestamp

Symbol, action, confidence

Reason summary

Price

Optional: result or performance tag (if available)

4. Run Performance Report
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python scripts/view_performance.py
Review:

Trade count

Win/loss

Avg return

Profit factor

Performance by agent or confidence

‚úÖ Success Criteria
System runs through decision‚Üírisk‚Üíexecution‚Üílogging‚ÜíPnL cycle with no critical errors

Log files update correctly and persist data

Dataset export completes with clean structure and useful content

Performance metrics are readable and reflect system state

Please save and commit logs from this test as v2.1.0-rc1 and tag the repo for review if successful.
