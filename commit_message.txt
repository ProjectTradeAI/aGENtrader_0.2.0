Implement standardized agent architecture (v2.2.1)

This commit implements a complete overhaul of the agent architecture with:

- Standardized interfaces for all agent types:
  - AgentInterface as the base interface
  - AnalystAgentInterface for market analysis agents
  - DecisionAgentInterface for trading decision agents
  - ExecutionAgentInterface for trade execution agents

- Enhanced base classes:
  - BaseAgent with core functionality for all agents
  - BaseAnalystAgent for market analysis agents
  - BaseDecisionAgent for trading decision agents

- Improved testing framework:
  - Individual agent testing via tests/test_agent_individual.py
  - Support for real or mock data sources
  - Detailed logging of agent reasoning

- Comprehensive documentation:
  - Agent Migration Guide (docs/AGENT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
  - Development Notes (docs/DEV_NOTES.md)
  - Test Suite Documentation (tests/README.md)
  - Updated README.md with architecture details

This architecture facilitates better maintainability, improved testing, and
standardized interfaces across all agent implementations.
