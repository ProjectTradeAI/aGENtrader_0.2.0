# aGENtrader v2 Development Notes

## Version 2.2.1 (Branch: v2.2.1)

### Agent Architecture Migration

A major refactoring of the agent architecture has been implemented with these key improvements:

1. **Standardized Agent Interfaces**
   - Created `AgentInterface` as the base interface for all agents
   - Implemented specialized interfaces: `AnalystAgentInterface`, `DecisionAgentInterface`, and `ExecutionAgentInterface`
   - Enforced consistent method signatures across all agent types

2. **Enhanced Base Classes**
   - Updated `BaseAgent` with core agent functionality
   - Refactored `BaseAnalystAgent` with improved analytics support
   - Created `BaseDecisionAgent` with standardized decision-making logic

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Implemented a comprehensive test harness in `tests/test_agent_individual.py`
   - Added support for isolated agent testing with mock data
   - Created detailed test documentation in `tests/README.md`

4. **Developer Resources**
   - Added migration guide in `docs/AGENT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Standardized result formats for analysis and decision outputs
   - Implemented centralized version management in `core/version.py`

5. **Logging Improvements**
   - Created structured logging in `core/logging/decision_logger.py`
   - Standardized error handling across agent implementations

## Migration Instructions

To continue development on this branch, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and checkout the `v2.2.1` branch:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aGENtrader_0.2.0.git
   cd aGENtrader_0.2.0
   git checkout v2.2.1
   ```

2. Follow the migration guide to update existing agents:
   ```bash
   cat docs/AGENT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md
   ```

3. Test migrated agents using the new test harness:
   ```bash
   python tests/test_agent_individual.py --agent YourAgent --mock-data
   ```

## Git Management

For version control safety:
- The previous stable version is tagged as `v2.2.0-stable`
- The current migration branch is `v2.2.1`
- Do not merge to `main` until fully tested on EC2

## Next Steps

1. Migrate all remaining analyst agents to the new architecture
2. Update the decision agent to use the new BaseDecisionAgent
3. Add integration tests for the full agent pipeline
4. Test thoroughly on EC2 before merging to main
