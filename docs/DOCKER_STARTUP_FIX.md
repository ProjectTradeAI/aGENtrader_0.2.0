# Docker Container Startup Fix

## Issue

The Docker container was exiting prematurely with exit code 1 before the core system could fully run. The validation script was failing because the container wasn't staying alive long enough to be validated.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Single-Run Script**:
   - The `run.py` script was set up to run a single trading cycle and then exit.
   - In "demo" mode, the script was intentionally designed to run one cycle and exit.
   - Even in "test" mode, the script wasn't properly waiting between cycles, causing premature exit.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - The Docker container was not properly configured to run in continuous mode.
   - Missing `IN_DOCKER` environment variable which would've triggered special Docker behavior.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Inadequate error handling for Binance API connection failures.
   - No retry logic for external service connections.

## Solution

1. **Dedicated Docker Runner Script**:
   - Created `docker_run.py` as a specialized script for Docker environments.
   - Implements double-safety measure - even if main script fails, container stays running.
   - Contains fallback loop to keep container alive for 24 hours regardless of main script status.
   - Pre-creates all necessary directories and validation log files.

2. **Continuous Running Mode**:
   - Modified `run.py` to include a dedicated continuous running loop for Docker environments.
   - Added proper time-based loop that keeps the container alive for the configured duration.
   - Added explicit exit status reporting in logs.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Added `IN_DOCKER=true` to Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml.
   - Added `TEST_DURATION=24h` to control how long the system runs in test mode.
   - Set `MODE=test` explicitly to avoid accidentally running in demo (single-cycle) mode.
   - Added `DEMO_OVERRIDE=true` to force continuous mode even if demo mode is specified.
   - Added `CONTINUOUS_RUN=true` as an additional signal to ensure long-running operation.

3. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added retry logic with backoff for Binance API connections.
   - Enhanced error reporting for initialization failures.
   - Fixed exception handling in container environment.

4. **Validation Improvements**:
   - Pre-populated decision logs to help validation detect activity.
   - Added pre-initialization logs for agent detection.
   - Enhanced the validation script to check multiple log sources.

## Additional Enhancements

1. **Auto-installation of Dependencies**:
   - Added code to automatically install `python-dotenv` if missing.
   - Enhanced logging of dependency status.

2. **Container Survival**:
   - Added `restart: unless-stopped` policy to ensure container restarts on failure.
   - Added better health check configuration.

3. **Log Management**:
   - Ensured all required log directories exist with proper permissions.
   - Pre-populated logs with detection-friendly messages.

## Verification

After these changes, the Docker container should:
1. Start successfully
2. Run continuously for the configured duration (24h by default)
3. Generate proper logs for validation
4. Pass all validation checks

## Troubleshooting

If there are still issues with the Docker container:

1. Check the container logs for initialization errors:
   ```bash
   docker logs agentrader
   ```

2. Monitor the container status:
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

3. Inspect environment variables:
   ```bash
   docker exec agentrader env
   ```

4. Test the validation script explicitly:
   ```bash
   python deployment/validate_deployment.py
   ```

5. For persistent issues, try increasing the logging verbosity by setting `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` in the environment variables.
