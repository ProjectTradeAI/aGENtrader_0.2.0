# ToneAgent Dynamic Tone Scaling

## Overview

ToneAgent has been enhanced with dynamic tone scaling capabilities that adjust the tone and confidence level of agent comments based on their confidence scores and data quality. This enhancement makes the agent outputs more nuanced and representative of the underlying uncertainty in the analysis.

## Key Features

### 1. Confidence-based Tone Modifiers

The ToneAgent now has different tone templates for different confidence levels:

- **High Confidence (80%+)**: Uses assertive, definitive language
  - Examples: "Decisively", "Confidently", "Absolutely", "Clearly", "Without a doubt"
  - Suffix examples: "with strong conviction", "with high confidence", "based on solid evidence"

- **Medium Confidence (60-79%)**: Uses balanced, measured language
  - Examples: "Moderately", "Reasonably", "It appears", "The data suggests"
  - Suffix examples: "with moderate confidence", "with reasonable certainty"

- **Low Confidence (Below 60%)**: Uses hesitant, reserved language
  - Examples: "Tentatively", "Hesitantly", "Perhaps", "There's a hint that"
  - Suffix examples: "though the signals are weak", "with low confidence"

### 2. Fallback/Partial Data Handling

When data quality issues are detected (fallback data, partial data, or heuristic-based analysis), special tone modifiers are used:

- Examples: "With limited data", "Based on partial information", "Working with minimal signals"
- Suffix examples: "but take this with extra caution", "though more data would help"

### 3. Data Quality Tracking

The agent now detects and tracks data quality flags in analyst outputs:
- `is_fallback`: When an analyst had to use fallback logic
- `is_partial`: When data is incomplete
- `using_heuristics`: When simplified heuristics were used instead of full analysis

### 4. Dynamic Mood Prefixes

The system mood now reflects confidence level with appropriate prefixes:
- High confidence: "bullish", "bearish" 
- Medium confidence: "cautiously_bullish", "cautiously_bearish"
- Low confidence: "tentatively_bullish", "tentatively_bearish"

## Implementation Details

1. Added confidence-based tone modifier templates in ToneAgent initialization
2. Enhanced prompt construction to include specific tone scaling instructions
3. Added data quality tracking in analyst information processing
4. Implemented dynamic tone selection based on confidence and data quality flags
5. Updated fallback summary generator to use the same tone scaling mechanism
6. Added comprehensive test scripts for validation

## Benefits

1. **More Accurate Communication**: Tone now accurately reflects the confidence level of the analysis
2. **Improved Transparency**: Clear indication when data is limited or analysis is based on partial information
3. **Enhanced Readability**: Consistent tone patterns help users understand confidence levels at a glance
4. **Fallback Robustness**: Even when the main Grok API is unavailable, fallback summaries maintain appropriate tone

## Testing Results

The implementation has been validated with both unit tests (test_fallback_tone.py) and integration tests (test_tone_scaling.py). All tests confirm that:

1. High confidence analyses use assertive language
2. Medium confidence analyses use measured language
3. Low confidence analyses use hesitant language
4. Fallback/partial data is clearly indicated with appropriate cautious language

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements could include:
1. Adding more tone variation for more nuanced confidence levels
2. Implementing agent-specific tone patterns based on their expertise domain
3. Adding visual indicators or color-coding in text output based on confidence levels
