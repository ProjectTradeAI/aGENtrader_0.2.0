# aGENtrader v2.2.0-RC1 Release Notes

## Overview

This release candidate represents a significant reorganization of the aGENtrader codebase. The primary focus has been on establishing a clear, maintainable directory structure and improving deployment processes while preserving core functionality.

## Changes

### Directory Structure

The repository has been reorganized into a standardized structure:

```
/
├── agents/               # AI agents for trading decisions
│   ├── data_providers/   # Market data providers (Binance, etc.)
│   └── ...
├── core/                 # Core system functionality
│   ├── logging/          # Logging systems
│   ├── trading/          # Trading logic
│   └── ...
├── data/                 # Data storage and management
│   ├── feed/             # Market data feeds
│   ├── live/             # Live trading data
│   └── simulated/        # Simulated/backtesting data
├── datasets/             # Datasets for analysis and training
├── deployment/           # Deployment scripts and configurations

│   ├── decisions/        # Trading decision logs
│   └── performance/      # Performance metrics
├── scripts/              # Utility scripts
├── tests/                # Test scripts and frameworks
└── utils/                # Utility functions and helpers
```

### Script Organization

- **Deployment Scripts**: All deployment-related scripts have been moved to the `deployment/` directory
- **Docker Files**: Docker configurations have been moved to the `docker/` directory
- **Utility Scripts**: General utility scripts have been consolidated in the `scripts/` directory
- **Test Scripts**: Testing-related scripts have been moved to the `tests/` directory

### Symbolic Links

For backward compatibility, symbolic links have been created at the root level for critical files:

- `binance_data_provider.py` → `agents/data_providers/binance_data_provider.py`
- `market_data_provider_factory.py` → `agents/data_providers/market_data_provider_factory.py`
- `decision_logger.py` → `core/logging/decision_logger.py`
- `live_trading.py` → `core/trading/live_trading.py`
- `build_image.sh` → `deployment/build_image.sh`
- `deploy_ec2.sh` → `deployment/deploy_ec2.sh`
- `deploy_local.sh` → `deployment/deploy_local.sh`

### Other Improvements

- Consolidated initialization files for each module
- Created dedicated directory for documentation
- Archived legacy and temporary files
- Improved organization of deployment artifacts

## Usage

### Running the System

The main entry points remain unchanged:

```bash
# For standard operation
python run.py

# For development/testing
python main.py
```

### Deployment

Deployment scripts should now be accessed via the deployment directory:

```bash
# Local deployment
./deployment/deploy_local.sh

# EC2 deployment
./deployment/deploy_ec2.sh
```

For convenience, symbolic links to these scripts are maintained in the root directory.

## Future Work

- Complete migration to module-based imports
- Further consolidation of utility functions
- Additional documentation
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Notes

This release focuses on code organization rather than functional changes. The core trading functionality remains unchanged from previous releases.
